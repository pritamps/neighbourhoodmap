# Neighbourhood Map

This webapp lists some nice places to eat around my house. I developed this as part of
Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree. High-level skills used here are:

1. Javascript along with jQuery and AJAX
2. The Google Maps API
3. The MVVM design pattern through KnockoutJS
4. Basic HTML and CSS with Bootstrap
5. Tools for web development: Gulp, Bower, NPM. Cool stuff
